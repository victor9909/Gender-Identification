## Project Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
### Instructions

The project contains the library that implements some machine learning algorithm and 
a support functions (that use the developed library), in order to run automaticallly.
To run the code:
 - Ensure that exists a folder called "data" with files called "test.txt" and "train.txt"
 - Run "python main.py"

Attention: The code creates automatically the folders that contain 
the score of different classifiers, DO NOT delete during the running because
they are necessary to save the plots.
